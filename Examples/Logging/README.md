The HiveMQtt package uses [NLog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog) and can be configured with a configuration
file (`NLog.config`).  Having this file in the same directory of your executable will configure the
HiveMQtt logger to output as configured.

See [this section](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client-dotnet#logging) in the repository README for more details.
