_This .NET MQTT client was put together with love from the HiveMQ team but is still in DEVELOPMENT.  As such some things may not work completely until it matures and although unlikely, APIs may change slightly before version 1.0._

We'd appreciate any feedback you have.  Happy MQTT adventures!

</div>

* **Easy-to-Install**: Available as a Nuget package.
* **Opensource**: No blackbox code.  Only trusted, tested and reviewed opensource code.
* **Easy to Use**: Smart defaults, excellent interfaces and intelligent automation makes implementing a breeze.
* **MQTT v5.0 compatible**: Backported versions 3.1.1 & 3.0 coming soon!
* **Globally Compatible**: Built to be a fully compliant client compatible with all reputable MQTT brokers.
* **Actively Maintained**: Built by the MQTT professionals that built HiveMQ (and do this for a living).

## Install

... via NuGet

## Quickstart

### Simple Connect

```c#
using HiveMQtt.Client;

// Connect
var client = new HiveMQClient();
var connectResult = await client.ConnectAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
```

#### With Options

```c#
var options = new HiveMQClientOptions();
options.Host = 'candy.x39.eu.hivemq.cloud';
options.Port = 8883;

var client = new HiveMQClient(options);
var connectResult = await client.ConnectAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
```

### Basic Subscribe & Publish

```c#
using HiveMQtt.Client;

// Connect
var client = new HiveMQClient();
var connectResult = await client.ConnectAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);

// Message Handler
client.OnMessageReceived += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Message Received: {}", args.PublishMessage.PayloadAsString)
};

// Subscribe
await client.SubscribeAsync("instrument/x9284/boston").ConfigureAwait(false);

await client.PublishAsync(
                "core/dynamic_graph/entity/227489", // Topic to publish to
                "{'2023': '👍'}"                    // Message to publish
                ).ConfigureAwait(false);

```

#### Subscribe to Multiple Topics At Once With Varying QoS Levels

```c#
using HiveMQtt.Client.Options;
using HiveMQtt.Client.Results;

var options = new SubscribeOptions();
options.TopicFilters.Add(new TopicFilter { Topic = "foo/boston", QoS = QualityOfService.AtLeastOnceDelivery });
options.TopicFilters.Add(new TopicFilter { Topic = "bar/landshut", QoS = QualityOfService.AtMostOnceDelivery });

var result = await client.SubscribeAsync(options);
```


* `result.Subscriptions` contains the list of subscriptions made with this call
* `client.Subscriptions` is updated with complete list of subscriptions made up to this point
* each `Subscription` object has a resulting `ReasonCode` that represents the Subscribe result in `result.Subscriptions[0].ReasonCode`
