# Events

This client has built in events to allow users to hook into any part of the client.

This can be used to modify behavior, monitor activity or extend functionality.

## Examples

### Display Connect Options Prior to Connecting

The following serves as an example how to utilize events.  This one simply prints out the HiveMQClientOptions prior to the connect command being sent to the broker.

```C#
private static void BeforeConnectHandler(object? sender, BeforeConnectEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    Assert.NotNull(sender);
    if (sender is not null)
    {
        var client = (HiveMQClient)sender;
        Console.WriteLine("Connecting to Broker with the Options: {}", eventArgs.Options)
        
    }
}

// Later...

var client = new HiveMQClient();

client.BeforeConnect += BeforeConnectHandler;
var connectResult = await client.ConnectAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
```
