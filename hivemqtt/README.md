</div>

## Install

    pip install hivemqtt

## Quickstart

```python
from hivemqtt import HiveMQTT
mq = HiveMQTT(host='broker.hivemq.com')

# Publish a message
mq.publish("/my/topic", msg)

# Subscribe to and retrieve a message
mq.subscribe("/my/topic")
msg = mq.get_topic_message("/my/topic")
```

## Very first steps

### Initialize your code

1. Initialize `git` inside your repo:

```bash
cd hivemq-mqtt-client-python && git init
```

2. If you don't have `Poetry` installed run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

3. Initialize poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:

```bash
make install
make pre-commit-install
```

4. Run the codestyle:

```bash
make codestyle
```

5. Upload initial code to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client-python.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Set up bots

- Set up [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates) to ensure you have the latest dependencies.
- Set up [Stale bot](https://github.com/apps/stale) for automatic issue closing.

### Poetry

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc
</p>
</details>

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U hivemq-mqtt-client-python
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add hivemq-mqtt-client-python
```

Then you can run

```bash
hivemq-mqtt-client-python --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run hivemq-mqtt-client-python --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client-python/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/hivemq/hivemq-mqtt-client-python/tree/main/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files
